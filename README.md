### CS601 Portfolio Project:

This project was designed for the course CS601 at Boston Univeristy - Metropolitan College. The intent of the project was to show the skills that I have learned in the course as well as presenting information about myself. The information on the website gives a background of who I am, my personal highlights and interests, skills learned in the course, and a web-based contact form.
