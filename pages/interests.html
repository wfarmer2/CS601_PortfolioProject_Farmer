                                            I have been an avid sports fan ever since my childhood. Being raised in Arizona
                                            has given me the opportunity to watch many Phoenix Suns games in person 
                                            and hopefully they will win the championship in my lifetime. I played
                                            basketball from 5th grade until the end of high school and plan to coach one day. I
                                            also enjoy watching football and participate in a fantasy football league. When there 
                                            are sports on television you can usually find me watching it!

                                            During the pandemic I found myself looking for new content to watch and stumbled across
                                            Formula 1 racing and have been a fan ever since. My favorite team is Red Bull Racing with 
                                            my favorite driver being that of Max Verstappen! I plan on attending a Grand Prix one day, 
                                            either in the United States of America or Canada.

                                            I love everything about movies and movie culture especially learning about behind the scenes facts
                                            how a movie is made. One of my fondest memories has been experiencing movies with my family growing 
                                            up and going to midnight premieres for the newest film that everyone is interested in such as Marvel,
                                            Star Wars, etc. Fun fact, I saw Star Wars Episode III five times in theaters as a kid when that movie
                                            was released!

                                            Another interest that I picked up during the pandemic was baking that was fueled by watching all 
                                            the baking shows that were on television. I have baked several batches of cupcakes and brownies
                                            over the last couple of years. A tradition that has started because of my interest in baking is 
                                            that every holiday season I make Christmas light cupcakes.
